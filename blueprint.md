# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple React application that serves as a live demonstration for the `react-binding-state` library. It showcases how to implement two-way data binding for state management in a modern React setup.

## Implemented Features

*   **State Management:** Utilizes `react-binding-state` for global, proxy-based state management.
*   **Components:** 
    *   `UserProfile`: A component that displays and allows real-time updates to a user's name from the global state.
    *   `Counter`: A component that demonstrates incrementing and decrementing a numeric value in the global state.
*   **Styling:** A modern and professional design with a custom color palette, typography, and component styling.
*   **Licensing:** The project is licensed under the MIT License.

## Project Enhancements

*   **Professional `README.md`:** The `README.md` has been rewritten to be more professional and attractive, with badges, clear installation instructions, and updated code examples.
*   **Removed Live Demo:** The "Live Demo" section has been removed from the `README.md` to focus on the library's usage and API.
