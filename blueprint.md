# Project Blueprint: React Binding State

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of a two-way data binding solution for modern React applications. It provides a `useBindingState` hook that allows components to share and update state in a simple and intuitive way, without the need for complex state management libraries.

## Features

*   **Two-Way Data Binding:** The `useBindingState` hook provides a simple and efficient way to create two-way data bindings between component state and the UI.
*   **TypeScript Support:** The entire project is written in TypeScript, providing strong typing and improved developer experience.
*   **Modern UI:** The application features a modern, responsive user interface with a dark theme and a theme switcher.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The application is built using a component-based architecture, with clear separation of concerns.
*   **Testing:** The project includes a comprehensive test suite using Vitest and React Testing Library.

## Styling

*   **CSS:** The project uses plain CSS for styling, with a modern design system based on CSS variables.
*   **Themeing:** The application supports both dark and light themes, which can be toggled using the theme switcher.

## Implemented Changes

*   **TypeScript Conversion:** Converted the entire project from JavaScript to TypeScript.
*   **UI Redesign:** Implemented a new, modern user interface with a dark theme and improved styling.
*   **Theme Switcher:** Added a theme switcher to allow users to toggle between light and dark modes.
*   **Test Updates:** Updated the test suite to reflect the new UI and functionality.
*   **Bug Fixes:** Fixed an issue in the `useBindingState` hook that was causing tests to fail.
